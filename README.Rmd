<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of spatialbiodiv is to calculate spatial and sample-based species
rarefaction curves (sSBR) and distance-decay of similarity curve from
spatially-explicit biodiversity data (i.e.) species presences-absences
or abundances from standardized samples in landscapes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of spatialbiodiv from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("FelixMay/spatialbiodiv", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Example

For an example application see the package vignette 
"Test analysis of simulated data":

```{r example}
library(spatialbiodiv)
browseVignettes("spatialbiodiv")
```
